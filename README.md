# description
a simple tab control as webcomponent..

usable in web-component-designer: [https://node-projects.github.io/web-component-designer-demo/index.html](https://node-projects.github.io/web-component-designer-demo/index.html?npm=@node-projects/color-wheel.webcomponent&html=%3Cnode-projects-color-wheel%20style=%22width:200px;height:200px;position:absolute;left:20px;top:20px;%22%3E%3C/node-projects-color-wheel%3E)

# development
## upload new version
simple run
  
    npm run release

then you need to go to github and create a release from the uploaded tag.
this will then create a npm package via github action.
